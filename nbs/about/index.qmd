Hi, I'm Andrew Look.

I'm a machine learning engineer, ex-startup founder, and part-time artist based in Brooklyn, NY.

### Work

I recently left my most recent startup, Aesthetic (YCombinator Summer 2018).

Before that, I did ML engineering at Pinterest from 2016-2018.

Before Pinterest, I worked on a mobile ad startup called URX from 2013 until [Pinterest](https://venturebeat.com/marketing/pinterest-buys-deep-linking-startup-urx/) [acquired](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pinterest-acquires-mobile-ad-startup-urx-1462298027) us.

### Side Projects

I'm also an AI advisor to [Long Journey Ventures](https://www.longjourney.vc/), occasionally helping with technical due diligence on companies with an AI/ML focus.

In spare time, I'm building audio-reactive digital art and training new team members as Head of Software for the [Titanic's End](https://github.com/titanicsend/LXStudio-TE) [Mutant Vehicle](https://www.instagram.com/titanicsend/).

### Art

I've been painting since 2013 (when I really needed a hobby to unwind from the stress of being a startup founder).

I've been experimenting with ML art and generative AI since 2016 (when I started playing with DeepDreams and GANs and making physical paintings ML from the outputs).

I've been making single-line drawings since 2018 (when I decided to experiment with adding a constraint to my art practice).

I've been making pottery since 2022 (when I wanted to experiment with making art in three dimensions rather than two).
