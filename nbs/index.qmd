## Hi, I'm Andrew Look.

I'm an ML engineer, ex-startup founder, and part-time artist based in Brooklyn, NY.

You can learn more about me on [my "about" page](about/index.qmd).

Lately I've been working on training ML models to generate single-line drawings in my style.

I've open-sourced my [models](https://github.com/andrewlook/singleline_models)
